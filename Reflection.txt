Welp, it was quite a challenge
Took me a lot of time to understand why get successors wasn't working. THen I figured out the reason: it was returning three different values, so too many things were being unpacked at a time.
Fixed that by dividing the single "node" variabel that was storing all of that information into 
three different variables: node (state), action, and cost
worked out quite well.
I attempted uniform cost as well, but couldn't figure it out. Will try agian later when I have more exp with python and search.
